# Libft Tester

![Last Commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Sfabi28/libft_tester?style=for-the-badge&color=red)

A comprehensive and strict tester for the 42 **Libft** project.

This is a copy of [Sfabi28/libft_tester](https://github.com/Sfabi28/libft_tester), with a few fixes applied on top: duplicate/dummy test cases were replaced with real edge-case tests, a routing bug in the original numbering that caused some tests to silently pass without checking anything was corrected, and a use-after-free bug in one of the original test cases was fixed. All changes are listed in `CHANGELOG.md`.

This tester includes **Smart Memory Leak Detection** via Valgrind. To ensure maximum speed without sacrificing safety, Valgrind is only active for functions that require memory allocation (e.g., `ft_split`, `ft_calloc`).

Standard checks (Segfaults and Timeouts) are performed on **all** functions.

## Features

* **Smart Valgrind Integration:** Runs slow memory checks only where necessary.
* **Detailed Logging:** Generates a `tests_log.log` file with specific failure details.
* **Crash & Timeout Protection:** Detects segfaults and infinite loops.
* **Norminette Check:** Includes a quick Norminette pass.
* **Forbidden Functions Check:** Verifies that no forbidden functions are used in your binary.

## 1. Installation

Ensure that the folder of this tester (`libft_tester`) is located **INSIDE** the root of your `libft` project.

**Correct Directory Structure:**

```text
/libft_root
    ├── Makefile
    ├── libft.h
    ├── *.c (your source files)
    └── libft_tester/       <--- YOU ARE HERE
          ├── .launch.sh
          ├── Makefile
          ├── CHANGELOG.md
          ├── README.md
          └── tests_log.log (generated after run)
```

**Important:** To avoid accidentally committing the tester to your repository, add `libft_tester/` to your `.gitignore` file:

```bash
echo "libft_tester/" >> .gitignore
```

Ensure that the path is right and set a proper timeout time **INSIDE** the `launch.sh` file

```text
   TIMEOUT_TIME=5
```

## 2. Usage Commands
-----------------
The tester supports different modes and optional integration with Valgrind.

```text
Command,Description
make   launches tests on all libft
make "function name"  launches tests only on the function 
```

**THE FUNCTION NAME MUST NOT INCLUDE ft_**

## 3. Results Legend
-----------------
```text
[OK]      : The printed output and the return value are identical to the original.
[KO]      : There is a discrepancy. Check the log file for details.
[LEAK]    : There are memory leaks in your function.
[CRASH]   : Your function segfaulted (Segmentation Fault).
[TIMEOUT] : Your function caused an infinite loop (adjust TIMEOUT_TIME in .sh if needed).
```

## 4. Use of AI
-----------
```text
   Many of the tests were made by AI.

   I personally checked them all before publishing this tester.
